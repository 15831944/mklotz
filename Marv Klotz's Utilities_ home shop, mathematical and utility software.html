*** NOTA BENE ***:  If you're too lazy to read this introduction, at least
read the last four paragraphs so I don't have to waste my time answering
questions already answered here.


These heritage DOS programs will not run directly on the newer 64 bit operating
systems.  All is not lost however.  Download and install the free program DosBox,

http://www.dosbox.com

and you'll be able to run heritage programs on your 64 bit system.

</p>

<p>

A collection of home shop, mathematical and miscellaneous utility
<b>freeware</b>. Almost all the programs written by me are written in C and
source code <i>is</i> included in the zip files - for submitted software,
source code availability is at author's discretion.  Programs run under DOS (I
don't <i>do</i> windows) - although I <b>expect</b> most will run in a windows
DOS window (recent feedback from a number of users confirms this assertion).

</p>
<p>

For the benefit of web novices, one can download the zip file by clicking on
its name in the tables below.  Once downloaded to your disk, unzip the file
using PKUNZIP, which can be obtained from the good folks at 
<a href="http://www.pkware.com/shareware">PKWARE</a>

</p>
<p>

Unzip the zip file in a newly created subdirectory on your hard disk.  You
will find, at the minimum, two files.  The file with a "C" extension is the
source code.  Unless you're into programming, you can ignore it (even delete
it if short of hard disk real estate).  The file with the "EXE" extension is
the program.  Run it by typing its name (without the extension) at the DOS
prompt.  If the program requires any auxiliary files (e.g. DRILL.EXE expects
to find DRILL.DAT) it expects to find them in the default directory, so make
your newly created subdirectory the default before attempting to execute the
program.  Many of the programs have built-in default values for the user
inputs.  Running the program using these defaults will give you a good idea of
how it works.  Naturally, the defaults can be overridden by user input.

</p>
<p>

I haven't had time to write extensive documentation for some of the programs.
If the zip file doesn't contain a documentation file ("TXT" extension), the
program itself contains (<i>I hope</i>) enough run-time hints so that a user
familiar with the subject should be able to get the answer he needs.  (Hey, at
the price I'm charging, a little effort on the part of the user is assumed!) 
If <i>serious</i> confusion is reported to me, I'll make an attempt to provide
clarification in a future documentation file.

</p>

<p>

Lest I bore more accomplished users with needless instruction, I've written a
<a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/notes.zip">NOTES</a>
 file which contains answers to questions I've received in the past.  Let me
know if you want any useful hints added to this file.

</p>

<p>

A number of DOS-challenged users of my programs have written to complain that
when the program terminates, Windoze, in another one of its mis-guided attempts
to think for the user, closes the window before they can inspect the answers
generated by the program.  Dave Wood has spent some time working out how to
keep Micro$oft's abortion from trying to outthink the user.  He writes:

</p><p>

In Explorer, right-click on the .exe program name. Select "Properties".
Select the "Program" tab.  At the bottom of this dialog is a single check-box
"Close on exit".  Un-check this box.  At the bottom of the dialog click on
"Apply," then "OK".

</p>

<p>

His remarks are specific to XP but I expect they are applicable to other
flavors of MS so-called operating systems.

</p>

<p>

Also, Anthony Nagy writes,

"I discovered that if you create and use a shortcut to run the program it will
run under Windows and  not terminate. I run Windows 2000. This may also work
with your other programs and other versions of Windows."

  </th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/3wire.zip">3WIRE.ZIP</a><br>(~30 Kbytes)<br>07/14/05</b>
  </td><td>

Calculates the best wire size and measurement over wires when using the three
wire method to check the pitch diameter of a thread.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/ballcut.zip">BALLCUT.ZIP</a><br>(~35 Kbytes)<br>02/23/05</b>
  </td><td>

You don't need to buy/build a ball cutting attachment for your lathe if you
only need to cut occasional, <i>non-critical</i> spherical shapes.  This
little program will give you a printable incremental cutting schedule that
gets the job done fast.  Guy Lautard documents this technique but I was using
it long before he documented it.  The tables in his publications limit one to
certain pre-determined ball diameters.  This program will produce a tailored
cutting schedule for any diameter.  BTW, this type of machining is referred to
as HAM  (Human Assisted Machining)!  See also PROFILE.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/belt.zip">BELT.ZIP</a><br>(~118 Kbytes)<br>11/29/05</b>
  </td><td>

While building a flat belt transmission system, I needed to calculate belt
lengths and pulley sizes.  The .zip file contains three programs.  One to
calculate belt length for an arbitrary arrangement of many pulleys, one to more
quickly solve the same problem for two pulleys, and a third to calculate pulley
size when the belt length is already set, as is the case with cone pulley speed
changers.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/bend.zip">BEND.ZIP</a><br>(~28 Kbytes)<br>11/11/98</b>
  </td><td>

When making bends in metal of non-negligible thickness, it's tricky to decide
how much extra length to allow for the bend.  This is a quick and dirty
algorithm that's worked for me in the past.  I lost the reference so I can't
credit its origin though I think it was Hoffman in HSM.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/boltcirc.zip">BOLTCIRC.ZIP</a><br>(~31 Kbytes)<br>10/04/05</b>
  </td><td>

It's often easier and more accurate to lay out holes on a boltcircle with x-y
coordinates than to scribe and step off the circle, especially if the number
of holes is an unusual number.  This program does the work and generates a
table which you can print and carry to the drill press for reference.  See also
CHORD.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/bucket.zip">BUCKET.ZIP</a><br>(~31 Kbytes)<br>12/16/99</b>
  </td><td>

How to calibrate a bucket-shaped (conical frustum) container.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/cam.zip">CAM.ZIP</a><br>(~44 Kbytes)<br>04/15/01</b>
  </td><td>

When I had to make a cam for one of my engines, I discovered how little I knew
about cam design.  I did some research and incorporated what I learned into a
program to design four common types of cams.  While I'm hardly an
expert on the subject, my efforts may be of value to some of you.  Any
professional cam designers can email me and tell me what I've left out.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/change.zip">CHANGE.ZIP</a><br>(~61 Kbytes)<br>05/21/05</b>
  </td><td>

Finally took a stab at writing a program to select change gears to obtain a
desired thread pitch/carriage feed.  With the usual data file for tailoring to
your equipment.  New improved version added 6/2/01.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/chord.zip">CHORD.ZIP</a><br>(~19 Kbytes)<br>02/24/00</b>
  </td><td>

For those who insist on marking out subdivisions of a circle the old-fashioned
way and don't want to use BOLTCIRC, this tool will compute the chord length
needed to divide a circle of input diameter into any number of parts.  See also
BOLTCIRC.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/cmiter.zip">CMITER.ZIP</a><br>(~21 Kbytes)<br>11/03/04</b>
  </td><td>

Something for the woodworkers.  Compute the blade tilt and miter gauge angles
for cutting compound mitered pieces to assemble into a 'polygonal conoid'
shape.  See also POLYCONE, SINE and SINEBAR.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/collet.zip">COLLET.ZIP</a><br>(~20 Kbytes)<br>05/29/04</b>
  </td><td>

John Way, writing in <i>Machinist's Workshop</i>, devised a way to make
collets for square or hex stock without using a spendy broach.  I coded his
equation for calculating the required collet bore.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/compound.zip">COMPOUND.ZIP</a><br>(~20 Kbytes)<br>01/10/05</b>
  </td><td>

Most of us are familiar with the process of angling the compound slide so that
a given movement of the slide produces a lesser movement of the tool towards
the work.  Given the required ratio, this program computes the angle needed to
achieve that ratio.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/cone.zip">CONE.ZIP</a><br>(~30 Kbytes)<br>11/24/01</b>
  </td><td>

Calculations for laying out a frustum of a cone on flat material prior to
rolling.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/conrod.zip">CONROD.ZIP</a><br>(~84 Kbytes)<br>05/03/01</b>
  </td><td>

Tom Roach in South Africa needed a program to compute connecting rod clearance
relative to cylinder bottom.  Between the two of us we arrived at a useful
description of the problem and the equations to solve it.  Tom's application
was IC engines but the calculation is equally useful for steam engines - either
cylinder clearance or crosshead guide clearance in engines that employ a
crosshead.  See also CROD.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/crod.zip">CROD.ZIP</a><br>(~44 Kbytes)<br>02/23/05</b>
  </td><td>

Tom Roach in South Africa suggested a program to compute piston position as a
function of crank radius and angle and connecting rod length.  A useful tool
for engine designers.  See also CONROD.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/cusp.zip">CUSP.ZIP</a><br>(~56 Kbytes)<br>10/30/02</b>
  </td><td>

When approximating flat surfaces with a ball mill, it's desirable to know how
far to move the cutter to keep the 'cusp' height below some value.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/cuts.zip">CUTS.ZIP</a><br>(~82 Kbytes)<br>03/08/02</b>
  </td><td>

Solves the problem of how to cut many pieces of various lengths from stock that
comes in standard lengths (e.g., pipe, lumber) with minimum waste.  A complete
cutting list is produced and an ASCII data file allows easy tailoring to your
problem.   2/14/02 added Mike Graham's much improved version of how to solve
this problem - CUTLIST.  Also included is REMNANT, which uses Mike's algorithm
to solve the problem of how to optimize cutting of parts from random length
remnants of available stock.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/dallow.zip">DALLOW.ZIP</a><br>(~28 Kbytes)<br>05/13/99</b>
  </td><td>

A friend wanted to drill a 0.5" blind hole 1" deep but didn't know how much to
allow for the tapered end of the drill.  Assuming you know the included angle
of the drill tip (typically 2*59 = 118 deg) this will tell you how much to
allow for the cylindrical part of the hole to be as long as needed.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/data.zip">DATA.ZIP</a><br>(~57 Kbytes)<br>04/04/06</b>
  </td><td>

Unlike most of the entries in this table, this is not a program but rather a
collection of data files I've compiled over the years.  I keep a copy of
CHART.TXT lying on my workbench for constant reference. (I printed it with a
Simtel utility that prints up to four pages of text on a single side of an 8.5
x 11" sheet!)  How many threads per inch on a #6 woodscrew ? - you'll want to
know if you make lathe chucks for your woodturning friends.  I won't vouch for
the accuracy of any of this data since I didn't research the files, but I
doubt any of it is very far off the mark.  BTW, I welcome any additions you
can make to this selection - help other amateurs with data that's hard to find.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/ddh.zip">DDH.ZIP</a><br>(~38 Kbytes)<br>06/02/09</b>
  </td><td>

A Differential Dividing Head (hence DDH) creates the possibility of large
numbers of divisions by using gearing to move the hole plate at some fraction
of the spindle rotation.  This program aids in determining which gears are
required for a given number of divisions.


</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/diam.zip">DIAM.ZIP</a><br>(~32 Kbytes)<br>02/23/05</b>
  </td><td>

A sister to SPEED.  Put the available speeds on your machine tool into the data
file and this will calculate the diameter range to machine for each speed as a
function of the material.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/diffthrd.zip">DIFFTHRD.ZIP</a><br>(~35 Kbytes)<br>12/23/99</b>
  </td><td>

Very fine threads are great for precise positioning and generating large torque
advantages but one seldom has the gear to cut the threads and, once cut,
they're very delicate.  A more practical approach in many applications is to
use a <i>differential</i> thread.  This tool will tell you all you need to know
to do it.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/dipstick.zip">DIPSTICK.ZIP</a><br>(~26 Kbytes)<br>01/14/06</b>
  </td><td>

Dennis Blagirowicz wanted a program to help him to calibrate a dipstick to be
used with a horizontal cylindrical tank.  Given the tank diameter and length
of wetting on the dipstick, this program calculates the fraction of total
volume remaining in the tank.  The program also includes similar calculations
for spherical, elliptical and cartouche-shaped tanks.  A recent update adds
bucket and barrel shaped tanks.  A further update covers horizontal cylindrical
tanks with dished and hemispherical end caps.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/divhead.zip">DIVHEAD.ZIP</a><br>(~97 Kbytes)<br>03/06/05</b>
  </td><td>

John Rothen wanted software for computing turns and holes on a dividing head
with a non-standard worm gear ratio.  I wrote a program that can be customized
via a data file for ANY dividing head configuration.  Also includes a program
to determine which hole plates you'll need to generate all the divisions up to
some input number.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/dot.zip">DOT.ZIP</a><br>(~29 Kbytes)<br>06/12/05</b>
  </td><td>

I don't cut a lot of threads on the lathe and I confess to being confused by
the myriad designations in <i>Machinery's Handbook</i>.  This tool computes
depth-of-thread (absolute and with compound at angle) for all the combinations
of sharp/flat roots/crests for the 60 deg. Unified thread form and can also be
used for other thread forms (e.g., Whitworth).

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/dovetail.zip">DOVETAIL.ZIP</a><br>(~31 Kbytes)<br>01/30/06</b>
  </td><td>

Dovetails are traditionally measured across cylindrical rods wedged against the
sloping faces.  This tool implements the associated trigonometric calculations.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/dplate.zip">DPLATE.ZIP</a><br>(~44 Kbytes)<br>01/29/02</b>
  </td><td>

How does one make an accurate dividing plate when one doesn't have a dividing
head?  It's a proverbial chicken-egg problem.  This describes a straightforward
way of doing it with nothing more than a lathe and a bit of mathematics which
the program will sort out for you.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/drill.zip">DRILL.ZIP</a><br>(~40 Kbytes)<br>02/15/06</b>
  </td><td>

Drill size utility.  Find drill given hole size or hole size given drill
designation.  Find tapdrill size for <b>any</b> tap (m or I) and desired depth
of thread.  Accommodates number, letter, fractional and metric drills. ASCII
drill data file allows one to tailor drill data base to whatever drills one
has available - drills I've left out are easily added.  Step drilling option.
Now includes thread <i>forming</i> tap drill computation.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/eccent.zip">ECCENT.ZIP</a><br>(~39 Kbytes)<br>09/15/01</b>
  </td><td>

Need to turn an eccentric and don't have a four-jaw chuck (or don't want to set
it up for a quick job)?  Packing the work in the three-jaw will handle many
jobs.  This tool calculates the amount of packing needed.  A more elegant
method employing a slotted tube is also described along with a program for
making the required calculations.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/egg.zip">EGG.ZIP</a><br>(~44 Kbytes)<br>01/22/03</b>
  </td><td>

Make breakfast on your lathe?  Well, sort of.  In Nevil Shute's book, "Trustee
from the Toolroom", he describes the making of (metal) eggs on the lathe.  I
wanted to explore the difficulties of doing that so I wrote this demonstration
program, based on my PROFILE, to prove that it could be done.  Since I doubt
that very many people want to do this, the program is just a demonstrator, not
a finished tool.  Should anyone want to get into the metallic poultry field,
contact me and I'll make it into a user modifiable tool.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/expand.zip">EXPAND.ZIP</a><br>(~34 Kbytes)<br>03/02/03</b>
  </td><td>

Calculate the (linear) expansion for various materials given the change in
temperature.  Also calculate the temperature change needed for an input change
in dimension.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/feed.zip">FEED.ZIP</a><br>(~30 Kbytes)<br>02/26/01</b>
  </td><td>

Yet another feed rate calculator.  You enter any three of: speed, number of
cutting edges, chip load per tooth and feed rate and the program calculates the
unknown quantity.

</td></tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/findthrd.zip">FINDTHRD.ZIP</a><br>(~41 Kbytes)<br>06/03/06</b>
  </td><td>

Andy Pugh, UK, has compiled a table of ~400 "standard" threads  arranged in
order of size (from 10 Whitworth instrument (0.010" dia.) up to 6" Gas)
identified by type.  A very handy tool for identifying 'mystery' threads one
might encounter - especially when dealing with British equipment. The list is
a bit tiresome to search by hand if one is trying to identify an unknown
thread.  I wrote a program to search it using either major diameter or pitch
as the search argument.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/fits.zip">FITS.ZIP</a><br>(~32 Kbytes)<br>12/28/04</b>
  </td><td>

<i>Machinery's Handbook</i> devotes nearly fifty pages to the subject of
various fits of a shaft to a hole.  Tubal Cain's <i>Model Engineers
Handbook</i> devotes less than half a page to the subject.  For reasons that
don't require elaboration, I took the latter data and incorporated it into an
easy to use program (with data file for your amendments).  Unless you're
building super high precision equipment, I think you'll find it more than
adequate.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/flute.zip">FLUTE.ZIP</a><br>(~89 Kbytes)<br>04/15/09</b>
  </td><td>

Tapered flutes can be made by milling a channel on a tilted workpiece with a ball mill.  This program calculates the depths of cut and required inclination angle.


</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/flywheel.zip">FLYWHEEL.ZIP</a><br>(~91 Kbytes)<br>05/26/04</b>
  </td><td>

Tapered spoke flywheels make a model engine look elegant.  Here's a tool to
help in making them.  Includes a .jpg sketch to make things more
understandable.

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/ftaper.zip">FTAPER.ZIP</a><br>(~285 Kbytes)<br>02/24/11</b>
  </td><td>

Two spheres can be used to measure a female taper.  This program uses the
measurement data to calculate the taper angle.  See also TAPER.


</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/gage.zip">GAGE.ZIP</a><br>(~32 Kbytes)<br>02/23/05</b>
  </td><td>

Confused by gage numbers?  What's worse, the systems for wire and sheet metal
are different.  This utility will find gage number given thickness or vice
versa.  With the usual ASCII data file so you can tailor it.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/gas.zip">GAS.ZIP</a><br>(~28 Kbytes)<br>03/11/99</b>
  </td><td>

The perfect gas law is a handy tool in engine design and elsewhere but it's use
and the units involved can be confusing.  This gas law calculator will help
keep things straight.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/gear.zip">GEAR.ZIP</a><br>(~32 Kbytes)<br>02/23/05</b>
  </td><td>

John Cooper's article on gear making in the 4/99 issue of <i>Machinist's
Workshop</i> inspired me to collect his clearly explained calculations into a
program that produces a data file to carry to the shop for reference.

</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/gearfind.zip">GEARFIND.ZIP</a><br>(~97 Kbytes)<br>12/01/04</b>
  </td><td>

Given a desired gear ratio and associated tolerance, this program will search
for a gear train that produces that ratio.  Similar to GEARATIO but doesn't
presume a pre-existing set of available gears.


</td>

</tr><tr><td><b><a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/files/gearatio.zip">GEARATIO.ZIP</a><br>(~29 Kbytes)<br>08/14/03</b>
  </td><td>

If you have a set of gears (e.g., change gears from a lathe), you may want to
use them to establish a ratio for some other application.  This program
automates the process of deciding which gears to use to obtain a desired ratio.
See also GEARFIND.

<tr><td><b><a href="files/helix.zip"
  >HELIX.ZIP</a><br>(~20 Kbytes)<br>06/09/03</b>
  <td>

One way to make an auger is to cut annular shaped (washer-shaped) pieces from
flat stock, slit them along a radius, then stretch them out and weld them to a
circular shaft.  Calculating the size of the annular pieces needed to yield a
desired finished auger size is slightly tricky.  This program will do the work
for you.

Jaring Siemensma, of the Netherlands, has written his own version of a program
to calculate the change gears needed to cut a particular thread.  While similar
to my CHANGE program, his is a Windows program and displays a nice pictorial

I do most of my computer work directly from the DOS command line.  I often
need to make a quick calculation and am too impatient to load the RPN
calculator I built.  I had long considered writing a command line Expression
Evaluator so I could just type in something like <i>EE 3+4*sin(37)/log(50)</i>
and get the answer immediately.  Then I discovered that Mark Morley (of lovely
Victoria in BC, Canada) had already written just what I needed.  I made a few
changes to tailor it to the way I think and am passing it along here. 
Technically, Mark did not  <i>submit</i> this program to me but, after reading
the included text file, I think you'll see that he has no reservations about
disseminating it so long as he gets credit for his work.  See also MATH.

Oliver Smit, in South Africa, sent along his g-code writer.  It's a Windows
program, so a bit bigger than the other programs here but it seemed like
something that would be very useful to many people.  You specify the tool
speeds, movements, etc. and it generates the correct g-codes, which can then be
written to a file for export to the machine.

An old trick for cutting a shallow groove of non-standard radius is to use a
standard size milling cutter with radius less than the groove radius tilted

A space to solicit information that better-informed-than-I readers might be
able to supply.  Beyond my own requests, I'll also echo legitimate, <i>widely

I've long wanted to write a simulation of a computer controlled milling
machine so that I could experiment with CAM before actually investing in the
hardware.  Beyond the fun of 'arm chair machining', such a 'toy' would also be
handy for planning complex hand-controlled milling operations and catching
errors.  On a lucky bookstore browse I found the book below. It answered most
of my questions <b>and</b> it includes both CNC mill and lathe (DOS)
simulators for developing and exercising G/M - code without ever getting a
tool dull.

<ul>
<li> The ID (in) of a finger ring can be found from ID=0.032*R+0.458 where
R is the ring size, e.g., size 6 ring has an id of 0.65 in.

</li><li> The major diameter of a numbered thread (e.g. 6-32) is given by
D=0.013*N+0.060 so a #6 has a major diameter of 0.138 in.

</li><li> A <i>rough</i> way to calculate tap drill size (DRILL is much better)
is to subtract the pitch (in units of length/thread) from the nominal diameter:
<br>
1/4 (in) - 20 (tpi) =&gt; 1/4 (in) - 1/20 (ipt) = 0.2 in (#7 drill)
<br>
6 x 1 mm =&gt; 6 - 1 = 5 mm

</li><li> pi~=355/113 with an error of only 8.5E-6% (22/7 is in error by 0.04%)
</li><li> A (US) penny is almost exactly 0.75" diameter.
</li><li> A (US) nickel weighs ~5 grams.
</li><li> A (US) dollar bill is (imprecisely) 2.5 x 6".
</li><li> A (US) standard(?) business card is 2 x 3.5".
</li><li> Zig-Zag cigarette paper is ~0.001" thick.
</li><li> Metric length conversions aren't difficult.  The (Imperial) inch is
defined as <b> exactly </b> 25.4 millimeters.  Memorize that number.

</li><li> John Pagett of Birmingham, UK sent along a clever way of converting
fractional inches to their metric equivalent.  Keep doubling numerator and
denominator until the denominator is 256.  Then the numerator divided by ten is
the equivalent in mm with an error of only 0.78%
<br>
13/64 = 26/128 = 52/256 -&gt; 52/10 -&gt; 5.2 mm  (correct value = 5.159375 mm)
<br>

</li><li> Steve Redmond points out that mm-&gt;in can be done approximately by
multiplying by 4 and dividing by 100.
<br>
30 mm * (4/100) =~ 1.2 in (correct value = 1.181)


</li><li> Rule of thumb for milling cutters:  depth of cut &lt;= 0.5 * cutter diameter.

</li><li> Stan Dornfeld sends along a handy relation he uses for calculating feeds
when drilling:<br>
d = drill diameter (in)<br>
r = spindle speed (rpm)<br>
f = feed (in/min)<br>
f = d * r / 30

</li><li> Quick way to compute allowance for standard 118 deg. drill tip:
multiply drill diameter by 0.3

</li><li> A one foot head of water exerts a pressure of 0.433 psi.  A 2.309 feet
head of water exerts a pressure of one psi.

</li><li> The flow (GPM = gallons/minute) from a horizontal pipe of (inside)
diameter d (in) can be estimated by measuring how far from horizontal the
stream has dropped, y (in), at a distance x (in) from the end of the pipe and
using the formula GPM = 2.56 * x * d * d / sqrt(y).

</li><li> Most people, when they make homemade signs, make the letters way too
small.  A good rule of thumb is 2.5 to 3 inches of letter height for every 100
feet of viewing distance.

</li><li>
Tap drill size for a thread-<i>forming</i> tap can be found from:<br>
         tap drill = OD - 0.0068*(DOT)/pitch<br>
For example, with a 1/4-20 tap and a desired depth of thread of 65%, we
have:<br>
         tap drill = 0.25 - 0.0068*65/20 = 0.228 in. (#1 drill)

</li><li>
This one from Redgie Joy:
<br>

When grinding cutting tools to an accurate profile it is difficult to prevent
the layout from getting destroyed by the heat of grinding. Neither Dykem blue
or magic marker stand up very well. Mix a dilute solution of Copper Sulfate
(Blue Stone) and water. A couple of small lumps dissolved into water is fine.
Add a drop or two of Sulfuric Acid (Battery Acid). The acid is not necessary,
it just makes it work better. Degrease the toolbit, then paint a drop or two
of the solution on the bit. It will immediately leave a thin coating of copper
plate on the bit. Wash off in water, then scribe the profile in the copper
plate. The copper will not burn off during heating, and since it is very thin,
it is possible to engrave extremely fine lines.

</li><li>

The Imperial measurement system is hands-down one of the most nonsensical
systems still used in (a few) industrialized countries.  One of its most
ludicrous examples is the system used for indicating the weight of an anvil. 
A triplet of numbers, e.g., a:b:c, is cast into or stamped onto the anvil. 
The first number is the number of hundredweights (cwt), the second number is
the number of quarters (of a cwt), and the third number is pounds.  Thus, the
formula for the weight of the anvil in pounds is:  112*a + 28*b + c.  The fact
that a <i>hundred</i>weight is really 112 pounds and not 100 pounds has
something to do with the British who thought eight stone 'looked' like about
100 lbs.  Since a stone is 14 pounds, 8*14 = 112.  Contact John Cleese at the
Ministry of Funny Walks and Ridiculous Units for further information.

</li><li>

The full series of BA (British Association) threads runs from N=0 to N=22.
The pitch of a given thread is given by P(mm)=(0.9)^N and its diameter is given
by D(mm)=6 * P^(1.2).  All BA threads have a thread angle of 47.5 deg.

</li><li>

The volume of a pizza of thickness 'a' and radius 'z' is given by pi z z a.

</li><li>

If you're going to check a micrometer for accuracy, it's important to use a set
of gage blocks that cause the spindle to seat at different orientations so
drunken thread errors will be noticed.  The preferred set for inch micrometers
is:  0.105, 0.210, 0.315, 0.420, 0.500, 0.605, 0.710, 0.815, 0.920, 1.000.
For metric micrometers the preferred set is: 3.1, 6.5, 9.7, 12.5, 15.8, 19.0,
21.9, 25.0.

I'm a retired aerospace physicist living in Southern California whose hobbies
include building model stationary (steam/vacuum/Stirling) engines from
scratch.  Over the years, I've written a number of programs that might be of
use to other home shop machinists.  The hobby magazines do not provide an
appropriate medium for disseminating such tools, hence this web page.  I hope
that other home shop artisans who have developed useful computer tools will
also set up pages like this.  If they don't have the time or facilities to set
up home pages, I'll be glad to consider submissions for this page.  (Any
submissions will be identified by author in the separate
<a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/#submit">Submitted Software Table</a>
so that credit goes where credit is due.)  I will
<b>not</b> accept <i>for profit</i> submissions - this page is meant to be a
location for <b>freely</b> sharing information of value to the amateur home shop
community.

</p>
<p>

I reserve the right to edit, amend, correct spelling/grammar/content, etc. of
anything submitted for reference on this page.  And that's the limit of
lawyer-speak you'll ever see here.

</p>
<p>

I welcome suggestions for utilities you might like to have me write that would
have general (ok, <i>almost any</i>) appeal in the amateur
metal/wood-working homeshop field.  I can't guarantee anything but I'm always
on the lookout for new and interesting programming tasks.
