Dave Baker, responding to a question in rec.crafts.metalworking about
calculating spring constants, wrote the following:

<begin quote>
My own formula is an adaptation of the textbook one derived empirically from
many measurements of mainly engine valve springs and also some suspension
springs. Those are very different in terms of length and wire diameter so a
formula that applies to both ought to be fairly comprehensive. I use it for
designing special valve springs for race engines.

With dimensions in mm.

Spring diameter (D) = mean diameter i.e. o/d minus wire thickness (or i/d plus
wire thickness of course)

Number of working coils (N) = fully compressed length divided by wire diameter
minus a further 1.7 (to allow for dead coils at each end)

(d) = Wire diameter

Spring rate in pounds/inch is

d^4 / D^3 / N * 60,000

Note that most helically wound coil springs don't have a perfectly linear
spring rate. The rate increases as the amount of compression increases. From my
own measurements of valve springs which have a travel of about 3/4" to 1" the
rate over the last 1/4" travel is on average about 10% higher than the rate
over the first 1/4" travel.

I've seen springs with a rate rise of as much as 20% and others that were close
to linear. I've found no particular explanation of why they vary and find it
can't be predicted from looking at the spring design. In any case all engine
valve springs are very similar in size and number of coils. It's something I'd
like to find the reason for.

Since Dave's formula has the obvious advantage of having been verified in
actual usage, I thought it deserved a place in the 'Submitted Software' section
of my page.  Dave was generous enough to give his permission to publish his
work.
