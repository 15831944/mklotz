To install and run and this software: 

- Unzip the file (I know, I know, since you're reading this you've
  already done that)

- Copy rgr220.exe and gear.ico to a convenient folder.

- Make a shortcut to rgr220.exe in the usual fashion.

- If you wish to bother, after creating the shortcut, right click it,
  select "properties" then select "program" tab, click "change icon",
  browse to the folder you've installed into and select gear.ico for 
  your shortcut's icon.

- There is a short help screen available in the program.
  Anything that isn't self explanatory should be explained there.
  Email me for any other questions or problems.

- One thing I would like to stress is the "tire height" entry.
  Since tire squat reduces effective tire diameter, the best method
  is to measure from the ground to axle centerline and then multiply
  this figure by 2. This will result in a more accurate result than
  simply measuring the tire's diameter. 
  Side note here: while calibrating a new electronic speedo in a 
  highway tractor with the aid of a GPS unit, we noticed a difference
  of several percent in the speedo reading when going from empty to
  loaded due to tire squat. I might add that the tires were properly
  inflated and legal weight loads were being carried.

- Another factor to consider is torque-converter slippage in auto-trans
  equipped vehicles (this would not apply to lockup converters - when
  they're locked) I can't give you a figure for slippage, unfortunately.
  There are too many variables. 5 to 10 % might be close for a "normal"
  vehicle at highway speeds. A value of 1.10 in the OD ratio slot
  would automatically add 10 % slippage to your results. (assuming no
  actual overdrive in trans)

- The OD slot can also be used for entering transmission reduction
  ratios; for instance, if you have a 2.80 to 1 first gear ratio, you 
  can find out how fast she'll travel in first. Enter the other 
  parameters in the normal fashion.

  Happy motoring, trucking, pulling, plowing or whatever to ya!!!
