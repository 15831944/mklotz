This submission contains the Windows version of the 'units' program.
The Linux folks should have units installed by default.
    
It is a commandline program, so run it from the commandline window
(Start/Run: cmd) or 'run in a console'.

You need to start it with:
    
   units -f units.dat
	
or with
	
   set UNITSFILE=\path\to\file\units.dat
   units
	       
Some examples of usage, with explanations:
	       
Q: Do I need to lay off dougnuts? 
A: Yes:

  You have: 185 lb /( 181 cm)^2
  You want: kg/m2
  * 25.614172

  Explanation: The BMI (body mass index) value above 25 signifies an
  overweight condition. BMI is calculated as body weight per square of
  height. The rationale for it is that, because body fat accumulates
  under the surface of the skin, and the total skin area is roughly
  proportional to a person's height, BMI gives sort of the average
  thickness of fat tissue.
  
  Normally people give the formula in one of several forms, with magic
  coefficients depending on the units in which you give the mass and
  height. With automatic unit conversion, you just specify the inputs
  in whatever units you please, and ask for the result in kg per
  square meter, which is how the BMI was defined:


Q: Is gas overpriced? 
A: I don't know, but it's in line with the electricity cost.

  You have: (2 $/gal) 65 mph / 25 mpg 100 hp 
  You want: cent /kilo W hr
  * 6.9733149

  Explanation: a typical car might have about 100 horsepower engine,
  driving at 65 mph, and using 25 miles per gallon. With $2/gallon
  gas, it costs about 7 cents per kiloWatt-hour to run this car, which
  is just about the price that Pepco charges for electricity. In other
  words, it wouldn't be much cheaper to generate my own power using a
  gas engine and a generator.

Q: What's the destructive potential of my laptop's battery? 
A: 29 grams of TNT explosive

  You have: 38030 mW hr
  You want: g tnt
  * 29.684715

  Explanation: /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/info reports that my recent full charge
  was 38030 mWh; I ask to convert that into stored energy of grams of TNT

Q: Electric kitchen stove's power is easy to calculate: 220V 15A, or 3.3 kW.
   What's the heating power of a gas stove? 
A: Also 3.3 kW, perhaps not surprisingly.

  You have: naturalgas 1 l / 10 sec 
  You want: W
  * 3296.6929

  Explanation: I measured the outflow from my burner, by capturing the
  gas into a plastic bag and measuring the volume by displacing water
  from a pan (for safety, if you repeat this experiment, be sure to
  let the gas out outside).  I got about a liter of natural gas in 10
  seconds; 'naturalgas' is a constant that 'units' knows about, equal
  to the energy content per unit volume of natural gas.

Q: Is Sun going to burn out soon?
A: No, it only lost 0.02% of its mass since it lit up 4.5 billion years ago

  You have: ( (1 kW / m2 ) * 4 pi sundist2 / c2 ) 4.5 billion year / sunmass 
  You want: percent
  * 0.022339361

  Explanation: I use the solar energy flux on Earth's surface (1 kW/m^2); 
  over the entire sun-centered sphere containing Earth, this amounts to
: 1 kW/m2 * 4 pi sundist^2 Watts. Sun is about 4.5 billion years old, and
  E=m c^2, so we can calculate the mass Sun lost in that time, and take it
  as a percentage of the entire sun mass. 'sunmass' and 'sundist' are constants
  known to the 'units' program. By the way, 20 MW * 6 weeks / c2 equals 0.8 g;
  c2 is a syntactical shortcut 'units' uses for c^2 (exponentiation).

Q: How long would it take to transfer 100 GB over a modem: 
A: about half a year (I could have asked directly for the result in years, of course)

  You have: 100 GB / 56 kbps
  You want: days
  * 165.34392
