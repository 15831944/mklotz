Don Nichols (dnichols@d-and-d.com) wrote a handy program to calculate the
approximate horsepower produced by a steam engine, given the various parameters
that contribute to the calculation.  

I rewrote his program to make the input more explicit.  Don has reviewed the
new program and given his permission to publish it here.

For those of you who prefer the original, unix-compatible version written by
Don, you can find it at:
