Johan (Joe) Smit of South Africa helped simplify the process of making cutters
to make gears.  He took the calculations from an article in "Model Engineers'
Workshop" - Making Gear Cutters an Update, No. 41, March/April 1997 - and
incorporated them into a Visual Basic program.

Joe didn't provide any writeup but rather recommends the excellent treatise on
the subject written by John Stevenson.  Said writeup can be found at:
