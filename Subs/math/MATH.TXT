Dale Holt, in Colorado, wrote a very useful command line expression evaluator
which he was kind enough to contribute to the pool of free programs.  It
incorporates two important capabilities lacking in Morley's Expression
Evaluator.  The ability to iteratively solve equations is extremely handy as is
the ability to evaluate an expression for multiple values of a variable without
the need to keep reentering the expression.  Reproduced below are Dale's
instructions.  Invoking the program with no arguments will write these
instructions to the screen.

The algebraic expression evaluator by Dale Holt, copyright 1993.
This program takes a standard algebraic expression and calculates
an answer.  Version 3.1  2004 January 22

The functions supported are sin, cos, tan, atan, acos, asin,
sinh, cosh, tanh, ln, log, exp, sqrt, abs, int, and frac.
Either ** or ^ may be used for exponentiation.
PI or pi is acceptable for 3.14159265358979323846
The trigonometric functions operate with degrees, not radians.
Parentheses may be used to group terms.  The symbols ^ and * may
have to be quoted or escaped to get past the UNIX shell.
The entire math expression may be quoted, if desired.
The use of (, ), [, ], {, } are acceptable as parentheses.
Commas will be ignored.

If variables are included, then you will be prompted for values
to be used and the expression will be evaluated with those values.
This mode will end when a blank value is entered.

Equations will be solved if entered with an x, y, or z and an equal sign.
The starting value for a solution search is entered by appending from number.
Examples:  x = 1 + sin(x)
           y / 5 + exp(y^2) - 30 = 0
           x+sin(x) = 4 from 5
Please note that a large error means that a solution was not found!

Commas will not be placed in the output if the executable is named mathnc
