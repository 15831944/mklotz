I built a boiler and used soft (430 degF melting point) solder to seal all the
joints.  (The solder doesn't provide any mechanical strength; it merely serves
to establish a water/gas seal of the joints.)

Now, we all know that you can't make hard-boiled eggs on the top of a tall
mountain.  The temperature at which water boils depends on the pressure of the
gas at the water surface.  The other side of this equation is, of course, that
with higher pressure over the water, the boiling temperature will increase.

How high does the boiler pressure have to get before the boiling temperature of
the water equals the (430 degF) melting point of the solder?

Folks with a physics background will recognize this problem as an instance of
the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.  Now, isn't that a *really* impressive
sounding name for an equation?  Any equation with such a formidable name cries
out for a program of its own.  

I wrote the program such that one inputs the pressure indicated on the boiler
gage (i.e., pressure above atmospheric pressure since most boiler gages read
zero at one atmosphere) and the program reports the temperature at which water
will boil under that pressure.

I was relieved to discover that the boiler pressure would have to get to 350
psi before the boiling temperature reaches 430 degF.  Since the boiler is
fitted with a 60 psi safety valve, I don't need to worry about a meltdown.
