	If you tilt an endmill off vertical and then use it to cut a shallow
groove in a workpiece, it will cut a radiused groove with a radius different
from the half-diameter of the endmill.  Machinists use this trick to cut
odd-sized radii when a cutter of the required diameter is not to hand.  A
typical application might be recessing the bottom of rifle scope mounts to fit
a barrel/receiver radius.

	The calculations that relate groove radius and depth, endmill diameter
and tilt off vertical are complicated and non-intuitive.  Thankfully, Steve
Horace has beaten the problem to death.  In his writeup below, Steve supplies
three methods of making the required calculations.  I've programmed the most
complex (and most accurate) third method.  As a check it calculates, internally, the
width of the cut and solves Steve's second relation.  The first method is
trivial enough to carry out on a scientific calculator and requires no program.

	Questions regarding the technique should be addressed to Steve.  He's
the expert.  Questions regarding the program itself should be addressed to me
(mklotz@alum.mit.edu).

	For those of you who have back issues of HSM (Home Shop Machinist
magazine), pg.10 of the May/June 1988 issue has a treatise on deriving Steve's
second relation.

===========================================================================

Listed below are three methods for getting a non-standard radius from a mill
cutter.  

The first is for a rough approximation, the second for a closer approximation,
and the third for setting the error you are willing to accept.

* denotes multiplication, / denotes division, [] denotes expotientals (squares
and square roots),
() and {} denote groupings of operators

Method 1:R=radius desired, r=radius of cutter, R must be greater than r 
Formula: r/R = sine of angle from vertical to cutter axis

Method 2: R = radius desired, r = radius of cutter, W = half-width of cut, R
must be greater than r

         R-(R[2]-W[2])[1/2]
Formula: ------------------- = sine of angle from vertical to cutter axis
         r-(r[2]-W[2])[1/2]

Method 3: First the deviation from the ideal radius must be defined, and then
the  depth of the cut, and the ideal radius desired.  

Let E = error allowable in cut, D = depth of cut, R = radius desired, alpha =
angle from  vertical to set cutter, and r = radius of cutter.  Find alpha and
r with D,R and E known.    All dimensions in inches and decimal inches.

Calculate D from the geometry of the job.  


Formula 1:
                            D/r 
sin alpha = ----------------------------------   = sine of angle from vertical
            1-{1-2*(R*D/r[2]) + (D/r)[2]}[1/2]        to  cutter axis 
                           

Formula 2
               2 + (D/R)*{(1/sin[2]alpha) -1} 
      r = R* {--------------------------------} =     exact radius of cutter
                         (2/sin alpha)                at minimum angle alpha

Formula 3: 

E = (R/8)*(D[2]/R[2])*{(1/sin[2] alpha) -1}  =  error in radius 

Formula 4:
                          1
sin alpha = ------------------------------  = sin of minimum angle of
           {1 + 8*(E/R)*(R[2]/D[2])}[1/2]     inclination at specified error


Procedure: Select the D, R and E for the job.  E is calculated from the width
and radius of the cut.

Next, calculate an angle using formula 4.

Then, use Formula 2 to find the cutter radius for that angle.  It will
normally not be a  standard size. 

Now, select an available cutter larger than the size found, but smaller than
the radius desired.  

Compute the new angle alpha for the available cutter using Formula 1. 

Formula 3 will calculate the exact error if needed.

When to use which method depends on the accuracy required and tools available.
If a tool close  to the desired size is available, either method 1 or 2 will
give good results.  If the need is  for a 6" radius and  the largest cutter is
3.5" radius, method 3 will give best results.

Set up the work in the mill at the angle required and cut until the full
surface is radiused.   Be careful to be on center before cutting, and to have
the work level left to right.
